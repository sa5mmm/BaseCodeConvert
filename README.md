# BaseCodeConvert
You can write a message using normal ASCII characters and this program will convert that message into any base (binary, octal, hexadecimal, decimal [and many others]). You can take that converted message, the code, and translate it back into normal ASCII characters, but  you have to know the base. This can be used to send friends messages without worrying about interception from other people.

To make the code even harder to break you can even edit the values of characters to stray away from the values that ASCII gives to characters, in order to make your code harder to crack. Just be sure your friend knows what settings you have used so that they can read your messages properly.

The only thing you need to use this program is the code.exe file. Once it is opened you a code.txt file will be created, this file is where your code will be stored and where the code will be read from in order to convert back into ASCII characters. 

To start open the code.exe file and you will be asked what you want to do.

You can write a message to be coded by chosing message.
You can have a code converted to ASCII characters by chosing code.
You can change the settings to change the base, or the value of the characters. Just be sure your friends know what you did so that they can decode your message when you send it to them.
All of your code will be saved to code.txt just copy and paste the message to send it to your friends.
